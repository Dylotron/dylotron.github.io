			<h2>Hello!</h2>
	<p>Filling this site will be a little tricky, mainly because I'm not actually sure what to put here!<br>
	I suppose as good a place as any to start would be to introduce myself. I'm Dylan, a film & literature student in his twenties, and who used to be decent at web design. Key thing there being 'used to', I fell out of practice because weirdly writing code doesn't come up often when analysing books, film & TV. <br>
	I live in the grand Scottish capital of Edinburgh, a city which over my time here has worked its way into my heart. I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely have fallen in love with the city and would love to stay here as long as I can. Maybe some time in Europe though. Germany perhaps? <br>
	Anyway, back to me. I am quite the nerd. I'm hopeless when it comes to socialising, but I can tell you exactly how a spaceship from Star Trek works. While this give me a ridiculous amount of random knowledge that makes me seem way smarter than I am, it hardly makes me a hit with ladies. As you can probably tell, tangents are commonplace for me too.</p>

			<h2>Violence in Movies, Sex on TV</h2>
				<p>My favourite show of all time is <i>The Expanse</i>. I think that it succeeds on every level it strives for, the only let down being it ending 3 seasons too early. While you can argue that it being an adaptation should disqualify it for having a source material, I do believe that the way it was adapted is masterful.<br>
				Mike Flannigan's <i>Midnight Mass</i> I believe is the best miniseries I've watched. The slow, rolling start as it establishes the status quo, only to flip it all on its head with a reveal that is equally shocking and well established. The production is fantastic and it paces itself properly meaning it respects my time. <br>

			<h2>Thank You for the Music</h2>
				<p>Music is a weird one for me.<br>
				I mean insofar as my tastes being all over the bloody place. If you shuffle my library you could start with synthpop that transitions to heavy metal and then ends at classical. With some shoegaze and drum'n'bass mixed in for good measure. An upside of this is that I usually have music for every occasion, though my anxiety means I will be very picky about what I play.<br>
