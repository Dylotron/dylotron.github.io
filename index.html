			<h2 id="about">Hello There!</about></h2>
	<p>Filling this site will be a bit tricky, mostly because I’m not really sure what to put on here!<br>
<br>
As good a place as any to start would be introducing myself. Hello, I’m Dylan, a film & literature student in his twenties, living in Edinburgh and who used to be decent at web design. Key thing being ‘used to’, I fell completely out of practice for years. Turns out, weirdly, writing code doesn’t come up often when studying TV, movies & books.<br>
<br>
Like I mentioned, I live in the grand Scottish capital city of Edinburgh, a city which over my time here has worked its way deep into my heart. And I’m not saying that sarcastically, I have fallen in love with the city and want to keep staying here as long as I can. Though maybe I’ll spend some time living in Europe. Germany, perhaps?<br>
<br>
Anyways, more about me. As anyone who knows me can attest, I am quite the nerd, an all but confirmed autistic one too. I’m hopeless when it comes to socialising, but if you asked me I could explain in great detail how the spaceships in Star Trek work. While being this weird gives me a ridiculous amount of random knowledge that makes me seem way smarter than I actually am, it hardly makes me popular. As you can probably tell too, Tangents are common for me.</p>

				<p>Let’s start at the top, with what I think is my favourite show of all time: The Expanse. I think it succeeds on every level, be it story, acting, music or look. The only let down is it ending 3 seasons too early. Technically you can argue that because it’s based on books, it shouldn’t count, but damn I think the way it was adapted is masterful. The show follows a group in the future, who start as workers on a ship carrying ice from Jupiter to the space stations built into asteroids. After a mysterious distress call, a series of events begin that threaten the whole solar system.<br>
<br>
Mike Flannigan’s Midnight Mass holds the title of being the best miniseries I have seen. Its slow, rolling start as it establishes normalcy, just to completely throw it on its head with a reveal that is equally shocking and meaningful. The production is impeccable, with excellent acting and great music. The show follows a man heading back to the island he grew up on, seeing faces old and new, as the local church welcomes a new priest. Slowly, some miracles begin happening around the island that seem tied to the priest.<br>
<br>
One of my favourite films, is 2015’s The Martian, my go-to feel good movie. A film about a man being stranded in dire circumstances on Mars, bringing people together all over the world to help bring him home. The way it fills me with hope for humanity is wonderful, matched only by Star Trek: The Next Generation. But more than that, it’s an earnest look at what future space travel could be like. Sure, the storm it shows on Mars is impossible, but the technology and spacecraft shown are fantastic.</p>

			<h2 id="music">Thank You for the Music</music></h2>
				<p>Music is a bit of a weird spot for me.<br>
<br>
I meant that as my tastes are all over the bloody shop, my music library looking like a shotgun shot of genres. If you press shuffle you’ll be greeted by synthpop that transitions into heavy metal then round to classical and ending with jazz. With some shoegaze and drum’n’bass in there for good measure. A good upside of this is having music for any occasion, though my anxiety means I’m very careful about what I play around who. Sadly just who I am.</p>
